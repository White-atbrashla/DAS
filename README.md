# Brash Labs Presents: Dynamic Agent Swarms - Labor as a Microservice on Demand

## Introduction

**Dynamic Agent Swarms** **D.A.S** revolutionize the concept of labor allocation and task execution by leveraging microservice architectures to deploy labor as an on-demand service. This repository introduces the foundational technology behind Dynamic Agent Swarms, exemplified by **Argus AI**, an early alpha project tailored for the financial industry.

## About Dynamic Agent Swarms

Dynamic Agent Swarms function by dynamically deploying specialized microservices (agents) that perform tasks based on real-time demands. This approach not only enhances scalability and flexibility but also integrates advanced AI capabilities such as recursive learning and data-driven optimization.

### Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Web Frameworks**: FastAPI for API development
- **Task Queues**: Celery for managing asynchronous task queues
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating and managing application containers
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Features and Capabilities

### Dynamic Deployment

Dynamic Agent Swarms can quickly scale up or down, deploying agents as needed to meet service demand. This allows for a highly efficient allocation of resources, minimizing downtime and optimizing service delivery.

### Scalability and Flexibility

The system is designed to handle varying loads and can adapt to different operational scales and task complexities, making it ideal for industries ranging from financial services to healthcare.

### Examples

- **Financial Services**: Argus AI utilizes agent swarms for real-time financial analysis and decision support.
- **Healthcare**: Deploying agents to manage patient data and treatment schedules.

## Argus AI: An Early Alpha Example

### Project Overview

Argus AI showcases the application of Dynamic Agent Swarms in the financial sector, focusing on tasks like market analysis, risk assessment, and automated advisory services.

### Optimizer

The optimizer component of Argus AI is designed to continuously improve task allocation and resource utilization. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze performance data and optimize the deployment of agents based on efficiency and outcome.

### Data Ingestion

Argus AI's data ingestion module is capable of handling large volumes of financial data in real-time. It preprocesses this data for analysis, ensuring that the agents have access to timely and relevant information for decision-making.

### Recursive Learning Enhancement

Recursive learning as a service within Argus AI allows the system to learn from each task performed, adapting and evolving its algorithms to improve future performance. This self-improving mechanism is central to maintaining the system's relevance and accuracy over time.

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

The architecture of Dynamic Agent Swarms involves multiple layers:
- **Data Layer**: Manages data ingestion and processing.
- **Service Layer**: Hosts the microservices that execute specific tasks.
- **Control Layer**: Coordinates the deployment and management of microservices.

### Data Schemas

Data schemas are designed to be flexible to accommodate the needs of various agents. Each agent can define its own schema based on the tasks it needs to perform.

### Generic Functions

- **Task Allocation**: Assigns tasks to agents based on their specialization and current load.
- **Agent Management**: Oversees the lifecycle of each agent from creation to retirement.
- **Feedback Loops**: Integrates performance feedback into the system for continuous improvement.
